# AIX-Market-Analyzer
# AI Crypto Token Growth Forecasting
# Overview
This project aims to evaluate the growth potential of AI crypto tokens by analyzing their probabilistic market forecasts and extracting insights into individual growth trends. Using advanced machine learning models, including LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) and the SingularityNET SDK, this analysis empowers individuals to make informed decisions about investing or participating in the AI blockchain ecosystem.

# Key Features
AI Token Forecasting: Evaluate growth potential and trends of specific AI crypto tokens.
The aim of this project is to compare probabilistic forecasts generated by the SingularityNET SDK with predictions from an in-house LSTM model.
Robust Analytics: Incorporate metrics of Robustness, Accuracy, and Decisiveness using Photrekâ€™s Risk Assessment Service.
Insightful Visualization: Provide data-driven insights for better decision-making in AI token investments.
